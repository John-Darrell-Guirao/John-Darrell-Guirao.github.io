                    The future. It is still unclear to me where would my path and decisions take me. To be honest, I am so fixated with what I am currently doing in the present to think about my future. The workloads from my school, full-time work, affiliated organization, and family problems is already enough to fill my mind. Furthermore, if I could describe myself as a person, then it would be as a "go with the flow" type of person. Meaning I do not really have a clear set of goals in life as of the moment (the goals that I've enlisted are things I just thought of by the way, it is because I really don't have anything on my mind).

                    Ever since I was a child, all I do is to expect the bare minimum or even nothing at all from anyone. That is why, I feel less disappointed if things did not go as planned as I already expected the worse to happen from the get-go. I believe, that this mindset will carry on in the future, maybe it could be a defense mechanism of mine so that I would not be overwhelmed with expectations from anyone. How I truly wish if only there was a device or a way that could show me a glimpse of who I am and what do I do in the future, I would immediately take a look at it. Maybe serve it as a guide for my current self in preparation for what small and big things that I will be able to do in the future. An unclear path that leads to an unclear destiny.
