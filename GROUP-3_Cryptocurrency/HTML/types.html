Bitcoin Cash was created to accommodate  larger block sizes compared to Bitcoin and allow more transactions in a single block.

Its logo was named and has an image of a Shiba Inu dog with bad spelling habits; thus “doge” instead of “dog” and it is considered an almost sarcastic meme coin. This cryptocurrency that started as a parody less than a decade ago has been on a wild ride this year as individual investors have piled in. It is based on Litecoin and uses the same proof-of-work technology... </q>
