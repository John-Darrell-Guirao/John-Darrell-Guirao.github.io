                        <strong>How does cryptocurrency payment work?</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>At its most basic level, a cryptocurrency transaction is a transaction of cryptocurrencies from one wallet to another. You'll need to have the recipient's public address to perform this correctly. You copy the address into your account and transfer the payment. Though this may be a simple process, this can be difficult and overwhelming for newbies. It is not uncommon for individuals to make fatal mistakes like transferring the different types of cryptocurrency to the wrong address or picking the wrong blockchain network. Because a cryptocurrency transaction cannot be reversed, it frequently results in huge losses. Cryptocurrency providers, including Binance, have developed new accessible cryptocurrency payment options to make the situation more efficient.</p> 
                        <br><hr>
                        <i>The exact steps depend on the payment processor, but the usual method is as follows:</i>
                        <br>
                        <blockquote>1. Someone expects to spend on a client, or a customer prefer to pay for a good or service.
                        <br><br>
                        2. The receiver provides a digital statement that may be paid through their preferred payment method. This is typically a QR code that contains the receiving wallet address as well as the required amount. For example, at the present market pricing, a $10 (US dollar) lunch would cost $10 of a particular cryptocurrency.
                        <br><br>
                        3. The payer verifies the transaction by scanning the QR code with the app.
                        <br><br>
                        4. The cryptocurrency is sent to the recipient's wallet or digital wallet.</blockquote>

                </tr> 
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>This entire procedure can be accomplished in a matter of seconds. It's also perfectly safe and more efficient than doing everything by hand.</p>

                        <p>Using a crypto-linked credit or debit card is another alternative for cryptocurrency transactions. This allows you to send cryptocurrency even if the recipient only takes money. You'll need to save money and tokens with your credit card to use a cryptocurrency card. The cryptocurrency exchange trades your assets for the required fiat cash and transfers it to the recipient whenever you buy something. It also is possible that you'll use cryptocurrency to pay down your monthly credit card bill. Based on the provider or banking institution, the specific terms will vary. Cryptocurrency cards are more widely accepted than cryptocurrency payment gateways. On the other hand, paying an acquaintance personally is more difficult unless they accept credit cards.</p>

                        <strong>Binance pay</strong>
                        
                        <p>Every Binance user has access to Binance Pay, a cryptocurrency payment service. It provides a worldwide and contactless method of sending and receiving cryptocurrency. You only need another's email, mobile number, or payment ID to transfer cryptocurrency. You also can make a QR code with cash, cryptocurrency, and a message to send to the payer. A collection of Stores that take payment with Binance Pay is also available.</p><br>
                        <hr>
                        <strong>How to use it?</strong>

                        <p>Go to the Binance Pay tab if you already have a Binance account. Before you can start sending and receiving money, you must first register a name for the transaction. The [Send] tab allows you to make a transaction using an email, mobile phone, or Pay ID, while the [Receive] tab shows your Unique code and allows you to modify it for each given transaction.</p>
