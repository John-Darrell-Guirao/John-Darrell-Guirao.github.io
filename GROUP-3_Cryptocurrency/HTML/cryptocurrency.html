In 2008, the first and by far the most well-known cryptocurrency was launched, Bitcoin.

                    Basically, it is a digital ledger of transactions, where it is duplicated then distributed to other networks of computer systems on the blockchain as well. Each block on this blockchain contains the number of transactions, which is also being updated whenever new transactions are done. A record of this is added to every participant’s ledger. Meanwhile, the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the management of the decentralized database managed by different participants. Furthermore, blockchain is a type of DLT where all transactions that were done are recorded with a hash - an immutable cryptographic signature.
