            <p class="txt-content">The unique features of DOGE that was considered by several investors are, DOGE’s inflationary status, its unique mining feature, and ties to Litecoin. However, since it was an early crypto entrant, Dogecoin’s mining model is based on the proof-of-work, which means complex computational problems must be solved to validate transactions across the blockchain.
