                <strong>Personal Information Privacy</strong> You must show the PIN code to the seller to make the
                payment. Which method do you think is the
                safest? Obviously, your PIN code is strictly confidential and you don't need to reveal it. You
                don't have to disclose your private key to anyone. Even the money you earn is fully encrypted.
                No one can see your payment details and they will never leak. Therefore, it is the best way to
                pay anonymously.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-content">
                <strong>Instant and Secure Transfer</strong> When you have cryptocurrencies in your digital wallet, you
                have valuable assets in your hands. You can easily broadcast to anyone without asking for permission.
                There is no price to transfer ownership, no stressful situations occur, and no documentation is
                required. However, compared to other scenarios such as transfer of ownership or closure of a bank
                account, you have to complete a wide range of paperwork and pay fees.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-content">
                <strong>No Mediatory</strong> The main advantage of Bitcoin is that it is primarily decentralized. Many
                cryptocurrencies are controlled by the developers who use them and the developers who own large amounts
                of currencies, or the organizations that develop them before they are released to the market. The
                purpose of decentralization is to freely control the monopoly of the currency and prevent a single
                entity from determining the flow and value of the coin. This keeps the coin stable and secure, unlike
                fiat currencies controlled by the government.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-content">
                <strong>Self-Managed and Regulated</strong> Governance and development of all currencies is an important
                factor in their growth. Developers and miners maintain Bitcoin transactions on their hardware and
                receive transaction fees as a reward. Miners are rewarded for their efforts, so they keep transaction
                records accurate and up-to-date, maintain cryptocurrency integrity, and keep data distributed.
